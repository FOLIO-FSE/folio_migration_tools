# Quick tutorial

This is a quick guide on how to transform and load bib-level MARC records into a FOLIO tenant. 

## Prerequisites
* Make sure you have **Python 3.9** or higher installed. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing various Python versions
* You need to have git installed
* You need access to a FOLIO tenant, with the following properties:
   * The **API gateway url** to the tenant (aka "OKAPI url")
   * The **Tenant id** for the tenant
   * A **username** and **password** for a user with the right permission sets/roles
* A file of MARC21 Bib records in .mrc (binary) format

## 1. Create a git repository for your settings and data
### The Migration Repo Template
The tools are build to be run within a certain folder structure and with a set of mapping- and configuration files. 

For this purpose, we maintain a [repo template](https://github.com/folio-fse/migration_repo_template) in order to get folks started quickly with the tools.

###  Create a repo or clone this one
Either use the Github button below to create your own repo based on this template

Or clone the repo by running 
```shell
git clone git@github.com:FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template.git
```

### Step into the repo and create the example folder structure py running
```shell
cd migration_repo_template
python create_folder_structure.py
```
Your repository should look like this:

## 2. Add your data, and configure the settings
1. Locate the MARC file you want to use, and move it into the ```iterations/test_iteration/source_data/instances``` folder.
2. Open up the mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json file in a text editor and replace the outlined values in the picture below with your values:

3. Save the file   

## 3. Install the tools and make sure they can run
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
The migration repo template is set up as a [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment) project. First, go to the root of the repository. Then run the following
```shell
peotry config --local virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install             # Install project dependencies (creates virtual environment)
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activates the venv
```
2. Test the installation by showing the help pages
```shell
folio-migration-tools -h
```

## Transform the bibs into FOLIO Instances and SRS records
The following command will invoke the first of the three tasks in the configuration task, the **transform_bibs** one. Have your password ready.
```shell
folio-migration-tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ transform_bibs
```
Congratulations! You have now completed the first step. Take a look around in the results and reports folders in iterations/test_iteration to get an understanding for what has happened.

## Post the Instances into FOLIO Instances and SRS records
```shell
python -m folio_migration_tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ post_instances
```

## Post the SRS (MARC) Records into FOLIO
```shell
python -m folio_migration_tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ post_srs_bibs
```
Now, you can go off and explore the records in the FOLIO tenant! Make sure to check all the reports and lists of failed records in the reports and results folders!
