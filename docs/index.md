# About the tools
FOLIO Migration tools enable you to migrate libraries with the most common ILS:s over to FOLIO without data losses or any major data transformation tasks. The tools transform and load the data providing you and the library with good actionable logs and data-cleaning task lists together with the migrated data.

## What data does it cover?
FOLIO Migration Tools currently covers the following data sets:
* Catalog (Inventory and SRS in FOLIO terminology)
* Circulation transactions (Open loans and requests)
* Users/Patrons (In FOLIO, these share the same app/database)
* Courses and Reserves (Course reserves)
* Organizations (Used in ERM and Aquisitions)

## What additional functionality is on the roadmap?
This is the loose roadmap, in order of most likely implementations first
* Orders (In development)
* Invoices
* ERM-related objects (In the planning)

Financial records are not on the road map, given the structure in FOLIO and the practice of libraries usually wanting to set up the financial structures manually.

## Can I use the tools for ongoing imports and integrations?
The tools are primarily maintained for performing initial data migrations. We recommend that you use native FOLIO functionality for ongoing loads where possible. 
In theory, these tools can be used for ongoing patron loads from systems like Banner, Workday, or PeopleSoft. But we recommend you weigh your options carefully before going down this path.

# Tests
There is a test suite for Bibs-to-Instance mapping. You need to add arguments in order to run it against a FOLIO environment. The tests are run against the latest [FOLIO Bugfest environment](https://wiki.folio.org/dosearchsite.action?cql=siteSearch%20~%20%22bugfest%22%20AND%20type%20in%20(%22space%22%2C%22user%22%2C%22com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars%3Acalendar-content-type%22%2C%22attachment%22%2C%22page%22%2C%22com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars%3Aspace-calendars-view-content-type%22%2C%22blogpost%22)&includeArchivedSpaces=false) as part of the commit process in this repo.

IMPORTANT!
the tests and the tools rely on many calls to GitHub, and you need to create a [GitHub personal Access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and add a .env file in the root of the folder with the following contents:   
```GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_.....```   
Then, either restart your shell or run   
```source .env```    
from the command line

## Running the tests for the Rules mapper
### Pipenv
* Install the packages in the Pipfile
* Run ```clear; pipenv run pytest -v --log-level=DEBUG --password PASSWORD --tenant_id TENANT_ID --okapi_url OKAPI URL --username USERNAME```
### Poetry
* Install the packages from the pyproject.toml
* Run ```clear; poetry run pytest -v --log-level=DEBUG --password folio --tenant_id fs09000000 --okapi_url https://okapi-bugfest-lotus.int.aws.folio.org --username folio --cov```
