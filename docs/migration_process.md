# The migration process

This toolkit plays the main part in a process using a collection of tools. The process itself is documented in more detail, including example configuration files, at [this template repository](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template)
In order to perform migrations according to this process, you need the following:
* An Installation of [FOLIO Migration Tools](https://pypi.org/project/folio-migration-tools/). Installation instructions above.
* A clone, or a separate repo created from [migration_repo_template](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template)
* Access to the [Data mapping file creator](https://data-mapping-file-creator.folio.ebsco.com/data_mapping_creation) web tool
* A FOLIO tenant running the latest or the second latest version of FOLIO

# Running the scripts
For information on syntax, what files are needed and produced by the toolkit, refer to the documentation and example files in the [template repository](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template). We are building out the docs section in this repository as well: [Documentation](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/folio_migration_tools/tree/main/docs)
