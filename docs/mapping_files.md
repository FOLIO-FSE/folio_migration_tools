# Mapping files
The repo contains the following mapping files in the Mapping files folder.
There is a web tool that helps you crate the mapping files for certain objects available at https://data-mapping-file-creator.folio.ebsco.com/data_mapping_creation

## What file is needed for what objects?

## Example Records
In the [mapping_files folder](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template/tree/main/mapping_files) in the [migration_repo_template](https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template) you will find example of these files

##  marc-instance-mapping-rules.json
These are the mapping rules from MARC21 bib records to FOLIO instances. The rules are stored in the tenant, but it is good practice to keep them under version control so you can maintain the customizations as the mapping rules evolve.For more information on syntax etc, read the [documentation](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-source-record-manager/blob/master/RuleProcessorApi.md).

## ðŸ“„ mfhd_rules.json
This file is built out according to the [mapping rules for bibs](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-source-record-manager/blob/master/RuleProcessorApi.md). The conditions are different, and not well documented at this point. Look at the example file and refer to the mappinrules documentation 

## ðŸ“„ holdings_mapping.json
Just as the item_mapping.json and the user mapping files, these files are esiest to create using the [data-mapping-file-creator tool](https://data-mapping-file-creator.folio.ebsco.com/data_mapping_creation)
You base the mapping on the same item export as you use for the items.

## ðŸ“„ item_mapping.json
This is a mapping file for the items. The process assumes you have the item data in a CSV/TSV format. 
The structure of the file is dependant on the the column names in the TSV file. For example, if you have a file that looks like this:
... | Z30_BARCODE | Z30_CALL_NO | Z30_DESCRIPTION |  ... 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 ... | 123456790 | Some call number | some note  | ...
 


Your map should look like this:
```
...
{
    "folio_field": "barcode",
    "legacy_field": "Z30_BARCODE",
    "value":"",
    "description": ""
},
{
    "folio_field": "itemLevelCallNumber",
    "legacy_field": "Z30_CALL_NO",
    "value":"",
    "description": ""
}, 
{
    "folio_field": "notes[0].itemNoteTypeId",
    "legacy_field": "Z30_DESCRIPTION",
    "value": "c7bc292c-a318-43d3-9b03-7a40dfba046a",
    "description": ""
},
{
    "folio_field": "notes[0].staffOnly",
    "legacy_field": "Z30_DESCRIPTION",
    "value": false,
    "description": ""
},
{
    "folio_field": "notes[0].note",
    "legacy_field": "Z30_DESCRIPTION",
    "value": false,
    "description": ""
},
...
```
The resulting FOLIO Item would look like this:
```
{
	...
	"barcode": "123456790",
	"itemLevelCallNumber": "Some call number"
	"notes":[{
			"staffOnly": false,
			"note": "some note",
			"itemNoteTypeId": "c7bc292c-a318-43d3-9b03-7a40dfba046a"			
		}],
	...
}
```
### ðŸ“„ Fallback values in reference data mapping
All mapping files (locations.tsv, material_types.tsv, locations.tsv etc) have a mechanism that allows you to add * to legacy fields in a row, and add the falback value from folio in the folio_code/folio_name column. If the mapping fails, the script will assign this value to the records created. Good practice is to have migration-specific value as a falback value to be able to locate the records in FOLIO


## ðŸ“„ locations.tsv
These mappings allow for some complexity. These are the mappings of the legacy and FOLIO locations. The file must be structured like this:
 folio_code | legacy_code | Z30_COLLECTION 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 AFA | AFAS | AFAS   
 AFA  |  * |  *    
 
The legacy_code part is needed for both Holdings migratiom. For Item migration, the source fields can be used (Z30_COLLECTION in this case). You can add as many source fields as you like for the Items

## ðŸ“„ material_types.tsv
These mappings allow for some complexity. The first column name is fixed, since that is the target material type in FOLIO. Then you add the column names from the Item export TSV. For each column added, the values in them must match. At least one value per column must match. Se loan_types.tsv for complex examples
 folio_name | Z30_MATERIAL 
------------ | ------------- 
 Audiocassette | ACASS
 Audiocassette | *

## ðŸ“„ loan_types.tsv
These mappings allow for some complexity. The first column name is fixed, since that is the target loan type in FOLIO. Then you add the column names from the Item export TSV. For each column added, the values in them must match. At least one value per column must match

 folio_name | Z30_SUB_LIBRARY | Z30_ITEM_STATUS 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 Non-circulating | UMDUB | 02
 Non-circulating | * | *   

## ðŸ“„ call_number_type_mapping.tsv
These mappings allow for some complexity eventhough not needed. 
 folio_name | Z30_CALL_NO_TYPE 
------------ | -------------
Dewey Decimal classification | 8
Unmapped | *   

## ðŸ“„ statcodes.tsv
In order to map one statistical code to the FOLIO UUID, you need this map, and the field mapped in the item_mappings.json. These mappings allow for some complexity even though not needed. This mapping does not allow for default values. Any record without the field will not get one assigned.
 folio_code | Z30_STAT_CODE 
------------ | -------------
married_with_children | 8
happily_ever_after | 9

## ðŸ“„ item_statuses.tsv	
The handling of Item statuses is a bit of a project of its own, since not all statuses in legacy systems will have their equivalents in FOLIO. This mapping allows you to point one legacy status to a FOLIO status. If not status map is supplied, the status will be set to available.
legacy_code | folio_name 
------------ | -------------
checked_out | Checked out
available | Available
lost | Aged to lost

## ðŸ“„ post_loan_migration_statuses.tsv
This is not yet a mapping file per se, but it is used to substitute the values in the next_item_status column in the legacy open loans file.
Leave the statuses you do not want the loans migration process to migrate empty and replace the legacy statuses you want to apply with the correct FOLIO ones.
